## Welcome to Joe Baillie's personal GitHub.io site.

### About Me

My name is Joe Baillie and I am currently a first year student at RIT. I'm originally from Redding, Connecticut, a town so small that it has to share its high school with the next town over, which is incidentally the only other town that knows Redding exists. Said school was Joel Barlow High School, totaling around 850 students, with my graduating class numbering 212. I picked up coding during my freshman year in my "Intro to Computer Science Class" where I found myself grasping concepts quickly and burning through projects weeks before they were due. This was then followed up two years later with my enrollement in AP Computer Science, which just so happened to be during 2020. Coding became my passion and escape for the first month or so of quarantine before I ran out of accessible activities on Coding Bat and Code HS. Now, I attend school in order to further develop my love for coding and software and hoepfully make a career out of this passion.
